Last week was really fun, I had the privilege of presenting at the [Power Platform Community Sweden (PPCS)](https://powerplatformsweden.se/) event in Stockholm on the 12th of November, and I took the chancee to discuss some topics that have interested my the last couple of months - the [Microsoft 365 Agent SDK](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/agents-sdk/), the [Teams AI SDK](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/teams-ai-library/welcome) and the [Microsoft Agent SDK](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/agent-framework/overview/agent-framework-overview) - as well as some other things, and a few words about AI architecture. 

[Sara Lagerquist](https://www.linkedin.com/in/saralagerquist/) is the driving force behind the Power Platform Community in Sweden, and it really is an amazing commnunity that she has created, so many nice people and an amazing vibe overall. 14-time MVP [Gustaf Westerlund](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gustafwesterlund/) held a great presentation about Principal Object Access (POA), a veeery techical topic that he still managed to make very entertaining and fun!
 
In my presentation I showed a lot of demos (videos, doing live-demos is scary), basically a "best of" what I have posted to LinkedIn in the last couple of months. If your are interested, here is a "super-cut" containing all the demos that I showed at the event:

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GJLqc2VH9CA?si=DBsFGrOUnNiiEM5C" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>

One of the main themes of the presentation was the creation of the "Power Platform Community Sweden" agent - a chatbot that could help Sara plan events, and that can be used from lot of different channels - like Claude Desktop, Teams, Copilot and a custom web app. I created an MCP Server for this purpose, that had a couple of simple tools that the agent can use:

- CreateEvent 
- CreateSpeaker
- AddSpeakerToEvent
- ExecuteFetch - for querying Dataverse using FetchXml.

In the first demo I showed this MCP Server used from Claude Desktop, using the list of past events and speakers from the [PPPCS website](https://powerplatformsweden.se/) and adding them to the database using MCP. The code for the MCP Server can be found in [this repo](https://github.com/adner/PPCS_251112/tree/main/PPCS_MCP). The demo looked like this:
 
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/aRRVufV1UMw?si=ZtLRllMFHgbi66dK" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>

Good thing it was a pre-recorded video that could be sped up, for the process of creating the events and speakers was painfully slow - it took almost eight minutes to create everything, and Claude Desktop was getting more and more sluggish as it went along, eventually almost grinding to a complete halt. Apparently, the really simple process of simply enumerating ~20 events and ~40 speakers and adding them to Dataverse in a loop, one at a time, using an MCP tool is real hard work for Claude. Why is that?

Perhaps this [article from Anthropic](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/code-execution-with-mcp) sheds some light on this issue, and if you are into internet flamewars [this YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1piFEKA9XL0) is also worth a watch. 

And if the result of the tool call is verbose, then that also gets added to the context – and the result is a sluggish, barely usable agent. This sounds exactly like what happened in my demo: each individual MCP call was simple, but the cumulative overhead grew with every tool call, eventually overwhelming the context window. Not good, not good at all. Is there a better option?

The article outlines an interesting idea – instead of letting the LLM perform repeated MCP tool calls, instead let the LLM dynamically write code that executes the tool calls. That way, the tool definitions and tool call results are kept out of the context window. Pure genius! But does it work? 

I wanted to try it out for myself, so I [rewrote the PPCS MCP Server](https://github.com/adner/McpCodeGenTest/tree/main/PPCS_MCP) from my demo and modified it so that it only has one tool - `RunScript` - tha can be used to run C# code that has been dynamically generated by the LLM. The `ScriptRunnerLib` contains a [small library](https://github.com/adner/McpCodeGenTest/blob/main/ScriptRunnerLib/ScriptRunnerLib.cs) that makes it possible to execute this code at runtime. The secret sauce here is the [Roslyn](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/) C# Scripting SDK, such as cool library!

So, I hooked up the new and improved MCP Server to Claude and the results were actually quite amazing! Instead of 8 minutes, it took only 41 seconds to add all events and speakers:
